#  ‚öõÔ∏è My First React Project
## ‚òÄÔ∏è Updated with a toggle for a dark/light theme üåô

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this project

This is a solo project that is a part of [Scrimba's React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) by Bob Ziroll.

At the end of every module, there's a solo project to practise all the concepts that were taught on the same module.

Every solo project has a list of features that need to be on the project, and a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card?node-id=0%3A1) to replicate.

In this project I had to create a Digital Business Card, with four different components.

The main goal of the project was to practise how to create different components and display them on a page.

A few months later, while learning React on the same course, I got too curious on how theme toggles work, so I decided to pick up this project again and implement a toggle for a dark-mode and light-mode to learn how it's done.

## üí° How this project was created

1.
- Created a components folder inside src directory to create a `Info`, `About`, `Interests`, `Footer` and a `Toggler` component. 

- Created an images folder to add the image I wanted to display on the Business Card

2. 
- The `Info` component is rendering an Image, name, title, description and two buttons, this component is styled on the CSS file 

- The `About` and `Interests` components are rendering random text and styled on the CSS file

- The `Footer` component is rendering buttons imported from FontAwesome 

- The `Toggler` component was the last one being added and is adding the toggler to the project, through props, is receiving the logic to switch themes  

3.
